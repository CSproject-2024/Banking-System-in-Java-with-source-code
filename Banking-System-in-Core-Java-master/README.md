# Banking System in Core Java

Internet is being widely used as means of communication and referred as window to the world. People now rely on the internet to search for information, to purchase merchandise and to be informed of different services provided by an organization. Most of the companies (emerging/existing) invest on their websites to promote themselves and the products & services they offer.  As a result, one can purchase a product or utilize a service from any organization of their choice whenever they wish regardless of their location, which is all just a click away.

The use of internet services is not limited to informative or commercial sector but in recent years it extended to banking sector. Now, many banks globally facilitated their customers with Internet Banking System to manage their accounts.

### Major Components

1. **User Interface (UI)**:
   - **Components**:
     - `Splash`: Displays a splash screen when the application starts.
     - `ViewCustomer`: Displays all account holders in a table format.
     - `ViewOne`: Allows navigation through individual customer records.
     - `WithdrawMoney`: Handles the withdrawal of money from a customer's account.
   - **Interaction**: These components interact with the user, capturing input and displaying information.

2. **Application Logic**:
   - **Components**:
     - **Data Handling**: Methods for loading, displaying, and updating customer records (`populateArray`, `findRec`, `editRec`, `editFile`).
     - **Business Logic**: Processes user actions such as viewing records and withdrawing money.
   - **Interaction**: This layer processes user inputs, performs necessary computations, and updates the UI accordingly.

3. **Database**:
   - **Components**:
     - **File Storage**: Uses a file (`Bank.dat`) to store customer records.
   - **Interaction**: The application logic reads from and writes to this file to persist data.

4. **APIs**:
   - **Components**:
     - **Internal APIs**: Methods within the application that handle data operations and business logic.
   - **Interaction**: These methods are called by the UI components to perform actions like loading records, saving updates, and processing withdrawals.

### Interactions

1. **Data Flow**:
   - **User Input**: Users interact with the UI components to perform actions such as viewing customer records or withdrawing money.
   - **Processing**: The application logic processes these inputs, performs necessary computations, and updates the data.
   - **Data Storage**: Updated data is saved back to the file (`Bank.dat`).

2. **Communication Protocols**:
   - **Internal Method Calls**: UI components call methods in the application logic to perform actions and retrieve data.
   - **File I/O**: The application logic uses file input/output operations to read from and write to `Bank.dat`.

3. **Integration Points**:
   - **File Operations**: The application interacts with the file system to persist customer data.

                             | - File Storage      |
                             |   (Bank.dat)        |
                             +---------------------+



### Example Interaction Flow

1. **User searches for a customer**:
   - The `ViewCustomer` component sends a request to the application logic to load customer records.
   - The application logic reads the records from `Bank.dat` and displays them in a table.

2. **User withdraws money**:
   - The `WithdrawMoney` component captures the withdrawal details and sends them to the application logic.
   - The application logic updates the customer's balance and saves the updated records back to `Bank.dat`.




### Detailed Explanation of Core Components and Modules


The Banking System consists of several core components and modules that work together to provide a comprehensive internet banking solution. Below is a breakdown of these components:


---

## 1. User Interface (UI) Module

**Description**:  
This module is responsible for the front-end interactions. It is designed using HTML and JavaScript to facilitate user-friendly navigation and operations.

**Key Features**:
- Dashboard for account management.
- Transaction history display.



## 2. Core Banking Logic Module

**Description**:  
This module contains the main business logic of the banking system, implemented in Core Java.

**Key Features**:
- Customer account management (creation, deletion, updates).
- Transaction processing (deposits, withdrawals, transfers).



## 3. Database Module

**Description**:  
This module manages data storage and retrieval using SQL. It handles all database operations to ensure data integrity and security.

**Key Features**:
- Transaction records management.
- Account information storage.



## 4. Security Module

**Description**:  
This module implements security features to protect user data and transactions.

**Key Features**:
- Encryption of sensitive data (e.g., passwords).
- Session management to prevent unauthorized access.
- Input validation to prevent SQL injection and other attacks.
